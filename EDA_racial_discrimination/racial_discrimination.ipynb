    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "In both the statistical and bootstrap methods, our p-values were less than our alpha. Therefore we rejected the null hypothesis that the proportion of call backs for each group were the same, in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the proportion of call backs for the two groups were *not* the same. In other words, there is a statistically significant difference between the call back rates for resumes that have white or black sounding names. And thus we conclude that race may have played a role in determining the rate of call backs for resumes. On average, resumes with black sounding names received call backs at lower rates than resumes with white sounding names.\n",

    "Our analysis does not mean that race was *the most important* factor in call-back rates. Only that race may have played an important role. The fact that the names were assigned randomly should account for other confounding variables which may have influence as well, such as education level, experience, gender, age, or geographic location. A future analysis may need to investigate the role these factors (and possibly others) may have played in influencing call back rates, in order to get a better idea of which ones had a stronger influence (or possibly *the strongest influence*) on call-back rates."
